Algorithm to Arrange Clothes in an Almirah

1. Start.

2. Take input as the number of shelves (n) in the almirah.

3. Identify different categories of clothes such as:
   - Daily wear
   - Formal wear
   - Traditional wear
   - Seasonal clothes

4. Assign one or more shelves to each category based on:
   - Frequency of use
   - Number of clothes in that category

5. Place frequently used clothes (daily wear) on middle shelves
   so that they are easy to reach.

6. Place less frequently used clothes (traditional or seasonal wear)
   on top or bottom shelves.

7. Fold clothes neatly and stack similar clothes together
   to save space.

8. Arrange clothes in each shelf from left to right
   so that searching time is reduced.

9. Label shelves if required for easy identification.
